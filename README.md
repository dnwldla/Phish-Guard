## Background
Voice phishing is an increasingly serious threat, where scammers impersonate trusted institutions to steal personal information. The traditional advice to "stay calm and composed" often fails in high-pressure situations. Therefore, an intelligent solution that can detect potential phishing calls based on conversation content in real-time is necessary.
## Our project
Current spam call detectors mainly rely on call frequency or blacklists, but PhishGuard sets itself apart by analyzing the call content itself, detecting specific words and phrases commonly used in voice phishing in real time. By analyzing the text from the ongoing call, PhishGuard provides an immediate evaluation of whether it could be a phishing attempt, alerting the user if necessary.
